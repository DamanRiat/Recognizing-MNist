## MNIST Neural Network Classifier
Welcome to my implementation of the  MNIST Neural Network Classifier. This project is designed to showcase the deep learning lifecycle through the complete process of developing a neural network model for multiclass classification using the MNIST database. The MNIST database contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each labeled with the corresponding digit from 0 to 9, providing an ideal dataset for practicing and refining image classification techniques.

# Repository Overview
This repository contains code and resources for developing a neural network model capable of classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project covers all essential stages of model development, including data preparation, baseline model creation, hyperparameter tuning, and data visualization.

# Key Features
Data Preparation:

Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
Normalizing and reshaping the data for optimal model performance.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Baseline Models:

Building and evaluating simple baseline models.
Comparing baseline performance to establish a reference point for further improvements.
Model Development:

Designing and implementing a neural network using popular deep learning frameworks.
Training the model with the training dataset.
Evaluating the model on the testing dataset to measure performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
